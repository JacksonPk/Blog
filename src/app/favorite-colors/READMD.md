Q: thanks. this is what I need.

now, I have questions about this code.
I always use usestate to get api response.

If I write a code myself, I will define
const [colors,setColors] = useState<string[]>([]);

and setColors when api response okay.
and make a return like this
{colors === [] && (
<div className='grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-8 w-full max-w-4xl'>
<ItemLoading />
<ItemLoading />
<ItemLoading />
</div>
)}
{colors !== [] && <ColorListContainer colorsPromise={colors} />}

is this a worse code compare to using suspense?
If yes, what's the reason


A
That's a great question, and it highlights a fundamental difference in how data fetching and loading states are handled in the Next.js App Router, especially when leveraging React Server Components.

Your proposed useState and conditional rendering approach (colors === [] && <ItemLoading />) is a common and perfectly valid pattern in traditional React applications or within Client Components in Next.js. However, when compared to the Suspense and React.use() pattern demonstrated in the Canvas, it is generally considered less optimal for initial data fetching in the Next.js App Router, particularly when using Server Components.

Here's why:

Server Components vs. Client Components:

Your useState approach: To use useState, the component where const [colors, setColors] = useState<string[]>([]); is defined must be a Client Component (marked with 'use client'). This means the JavaScript for that component needs to be downloaded and executed in the browser before the data fetching can even begin.
Suspense and React.use() in the Canvas: The fetch call to /api/colors happens directly within src/app/favorite-color/page.tsx, which is a Server Component. Server Components execute on the server before any JavaScript is sent to the client. This means the data fetching starts much earlier in the request lifecycle.
Performance (Time To First Byte & First Contentful Paint):

Your useState approach: The browser first receives the HTML, then downloads the client-side JavaScript, then executes it, then the JavaScript initiates the API call, and finally, the UI updates. This sequential process can lead to a slower "Time To First Byte" (TTFB) and "First Contentful Paint" (FCP) because the client has to do more work before content appears.
Suspense and React.use() in the Canvas: The server initiates the data fetch and renders the initial HTML with the Suspense fallback (ItemLoading components). This HTML is streamed to the client immediately. While the client is rendering the loading UI, the server continues fetching data. Once the data is ready on the server, Next.js streams the final HTML with the actual content, seamlessly swapping out the loading state. This leads to a faster perceived load time and a better user experience because the user sees something meaningful (the loading state) much sooner.
Client-Side JavaScript Bundle Size:

Your useState approach: Requires more client-side JavaScript for managing the state, initiating the fetch, and handling the conditional rendering logic.
Suspense and React.use() in the Canvas: The data fetching logic remains on the server. The client-side JavaScript only needs to handle the Suspense boundaries and the React.use() hook, which is part of React's core and is highly optimized. This generally results in smaller client-side bundles.
Automatic Deduplication and Caching:

Next.js automatically deduplicates fetch requests made within Server Components during a single render pass. If multiple Server Components or the same component rendered multiple times try to fetch the same data, Next.js will only make one actual network request. This is harder to implement manually with useState and useEffect on the client.
Next.js's fetch also integrates with its caching mechanisms, allowing for more efficient data management.
Declarative Loading States:

Suspense provides a declarative way to define loading states. You simply wrap a component that might suspend (like ColorListContainer using React.use()) and provide a fallback. React handles the orchestration of showing and hiding the fallback.
Your useState approach requires manual conditional rendering logic (colors === [] && ...) and state management (isLoading, setColors), which can become more complex in larger applications with multiple data dependencies.
In essence, the Suspense and React.use() pattern (when used with Server Components) is the idiomatic and more performant way to handle initial data fetching and loading states in the Next.js App Router. It leverages the server-side rendering capabilities of Next.js and React's concurrent features to provide a superior user experience and optimize application performance. While useState is essential for client-side interactivity, for initial data fetching, the App Router's built-in mechanisms are designed to be more efficient.

Key Differences in Error Handling:

Declarative vs. Imperative:

useState way: You imperatively manage isLoading, error, data states and conditionally render based on them.
Suspense way: You declaratively define areas that can suspend (Suspense boundaries) and areas that can error (error.tsx boundaries). React automatically orchestrates showing the fallback or error UI.
Scope of Error Handling:

useState way: The try...catch typically handles errors within the component it's defined in. If an error occurs deeper in the component tree, you'd need more try...catch blocks or separate useState error boundaries.
Suspense way: error.tsx acts as a true Error Boundary. It catches errors bubbling up from any of its child components (both Server and Client Components) that are within its scope. This allows you to centralize error handling UI for entire segments of your application.
Server-Side vs. Client-Side Error Catching:

useState way: Errors from the fetch will be caught client-side.
Suspense way: Errors originating from async Server Components (like network errors during initial data fetch) are effectively caught by a client-side error.tsx boundary during the hydration process or subsequent renders.
In summary, while the useState approach gives you fine-grained imperative control over error states within a single component, the Suspense and error.tsx pattern in the App Router encourages a more robust, declarative, and centralized error handling strategy that spans both server-rendered and client-rendered parts of your application. It integrates seamlessly with streaming and provides a better user experience for unexpected failures.
